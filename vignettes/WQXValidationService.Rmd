## TADA Leverages the Water Quality eXchange (WQX) QAQC Service

This is a overview of the the WQX Quality Assurance and Quality Control
(QAQC) data submission service, and how TADA leverages that service to
flag potentially suspect data in the Water Quality Portal (WQP). It will
cover: 1) an overview of all available WQX QAQC tests for data
submissions, 2) which of these QAQC tests are also available in TADA for
flagging potentially suspect WQP data, and 3) how to interpret and
provide feedback on the validation reference tables referenced by WQX
and TADA for this QAQC service.

## Background

The WQX expectation for submissions is that users submit only QAQC'd
data and utilize WQX elements to ensure the data is of "documented
quality". The WQX team has historically hosted data quality working
groups aimed at creating best practices and required data elements for
WQX 3.0 for specific parameter groups such as nutrients, metals and
biological data. These resources have supported users to submit data of
documented quality. This approach has been broadly successful, but
because it is not an enforceable approach it has allowed for data of
varying quality to be shared. In response, the WQX team recently
released a QAQC service in 2022 to test and flag data submissions for
potential errors, and provide the data submitter with a chance to make
edits to improve the quality of their data, before it goes into the WQP.
However the new WQX services will not flag or fix data historical that
is already in the WQP. Therefore, the TADA R package leverages the WQX
QAQC Validation Reference tables in the R package to make these same
tests available on WQP outbound data using R.

## Available Tests

Tests available in both WQX Web for data submissions & the TADA R
Package for use with data retrieved from the WQP:

-   Tests that Leverage the WQX Validation Table

    -   Flag suspect characteristic and unit combinations (e.g., flag
        data if mg/L or °C was used for pH; flag if units were left
        blank, NA, None, etc. but are required for the characteristic)

        -   [TADA_FlagResultUnit()](https://usepa.github.io/EPATADA/reference/TADA_FlagResultUnit.html)

    -   Flag data without methods, with uncommon methods, or with
        suspect methods for the characteristic. This is contingent on
        the activity type since some activity types don't require
        methods.

        -   [TADA_FlagMethod()](https://usepa.github.io/EPATADA/reference/TADA_FlagMethod.html)

    -   Flag data with suspect characteristic and fraction combinations

        -   [TADA_FlagFraction()](https://usepa.github.io/EPATADA/reference/TADA_FlagFraction.html)

    -   Flag data with suspect characteristic and speciation combination

        -   [TADA_FlagSpeciation()](https://usepa.github.io/EPATADA/reference/TADA_FlagSpeciation.html)

    -   Flag results that do not have an approved QAPP and/or do not
        include a QAPP attachment

        -   [TADA_FindQAPPDoc()](https://usepa.github.io/EPATADA/reference/TADA_FindQAPPDoc.html)

        -   [TADA_FindQAPPApproval()](https://usepa.github.io/EPATADA/reference/TADA_FindQAPPApproval.html)

    -   Flag results above or below national thresholds using the
        Interquartile Range (IQR) method. The IQR method is defined as
        the difference between the 75% percentile and the 25% percentile
        of your dataset.

        -   Upper Threshold= 75th Percentile + 1.5 \* (75th percentile -
            25th percentile)

            -   [TADA_FlagAboveThreshold()](https://usepa.github.io/EPATADA/reference/TADA_FlagAboveThreshold.html)

        -   Lower Threshold= 25th Percentile - 1.5 \* (75th percentile -
            25th percentile)

            -   [TADA_FlagBelowThreshold()](https://usepa.github.io/EPATADA/reference/TADA_FlagBelowThreshold.html)

Additional tests only available in WQX Web and Node Submissions (for
now):

-   Location

    -   Flag data where accuracy of lat/long is less than three three
        decimal degrees (e.g., 38.88°, -77.00°)

    -   Flag data where the lat/long assigned to monitoring sites is NOT
        in the state and country included in metadata

    -   Flag if monitoring locations nearby each other are likely the
        same based on three decimal degrees precision. Includes two
        flags - one within your org and one national (across all orgs).
        If they are, then provide user an option to use the existing
        monitoring location instead of creating a new one [expand here].

## Providing Feedback on Validation Tables

All WQX Domain Tables are available
[HERE](https://www.epa.gov/waterdata/storage-and-retrieval-and-water-quality-exchange-domain-services-and-downloads).
TADA leverages many of the WQX domain tables.

-   [QAQCCharacteristicValidation
    (ZIP)](https://cdx.epa.gov/wqx/download/DomainValues/QAQCCharacteristicValidation_CSV.zip) \|
    ([XML](https://cdx.epa.gov/wqx/download/DomainValues/QAQCCharacteristicValidation.zip)) 
    \|
    ([CSV)](https://cdx.epa.gov/wqx/download/DomainValues/QAQCCharacteristicValidation.CSV)

    -   Both WQX and TADA leverage the table above to flag suspect and
        uncommon results. This reference table is used in the following
        TADA functions:

        -   [TADA_FlagAboveThreshold()](https://usepa.github.io/EPATADA/reference/TADA_FlagAboveThreshold.html)

        -   [TADA_FlagBelowThreshold()](https://usepa.github.io/EPATADA/reference/TADA_FlagBelowThreshold.html)

        -   [TADA_FlagResultUnit()](https://usepa.github.io/EPATADA/reference/TADA_FlagResultUnit.html)

        -   [TADA_FlagMethod()](https://usepa.github.io/EPATADA/reference/TADA_FlagMethod.html)

        -   [TADA_FlagFraction()](https://usepa.github.io/EPATADA/reference/TADA_FlagFraction.html)

        -   [TADA_FlagSpeciation()](https://usepa.github.io/EPATADA/reference/TADA_FlagSpeciation.html)

-   [MeasureUnit
    (ZIP)](https://cdx.epa.gov/wqx/download/DomainValues/MeasureUnit_CSV.zip) \|
    ([XML](https://cdx.epa.gov/wqx/download/DomainValues/MeasureUnit.zip))\| [(CSV)](https://cdx.epa.gov/wqx/download/DomainValues/MeasureUnit.CSV)

    -   Both WQX and TADA leverage the table above to convert all data
        for each unique characteristic to a consistent unit, so that
        results can then we assessed against the WQX upper and lower
        thresholds in the validation table. Target units for each
        charactersitic are included in the MeasureUnit domain table.
        TADA leverages this table to convert all data for each unique
        characteristic to a consistent target unit. See relevant TADA
        functions:

    -   See TADA Function:
        [TADA_ConvertResultUnits()](https://usepa.github.io/EPATADA/reference/TADA_ConvertResultUnits.html)

All TADA Reference and Validation Tables are also available in the R
Package
[HERE](https://github.com/USEPA/EPATADA/tree/develop/inst/extdata). TADA
pulls the WQX Validation Table and other domain tables into TADA and
updates them automatically whenever changes are made

-   <https://github.com/USEPA/EPATADA/blob/develop/inst/extdata/WQXcharValRef.csv>

-   <https://github.com/USEPA/EPATADA/blob/develop/inst/extdata/WQXunitRef.csv>

WQX and TADA users can review and provide feedback on the validation
table and/or target units assigned, and provide feedback by emailing the
WQX helpdesk (WQX\@epa.gov).
