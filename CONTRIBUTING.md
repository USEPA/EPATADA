We encourage you to read this project’s CONTRIBUTING policy (you are here), its
LICENSE, and its [README](https://github.com/USEPA/TADA/blob/develop/readme.md).

All contributions to this project will be released under the CCO dedication. By submitting a pull request or issue, you are agreeing to comply with this waiver of copyright interest.
