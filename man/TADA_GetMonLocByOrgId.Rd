\title{Get WQP Organization Identifier For Each WQP Monitoring Location Identifier}
\usage{
TADA_GetMonLocByOrgId(.data, id = "wqp")
}
\arguments{
\item{.data}{A TADA dataframe.}

\item{id}{Character argument. Determines which monitoring location identifier
and organization identifier from the TADA dataframe to display. When
id = "wqp", 'MonitoringLocationIdentifier' is used. When id = "tada",
'TADA.MonitoringLocationIdentifier" is used. Default is id = "wqp".}
}
\value{
A crosswalk dataframe of monitoring location identifiers and organization identifiers.
}
\description{
This function creates a dataframe with two columns to show the organization
identifier for each monitoring location. The user can select whether the
monitoring location identifier column displays the original WQP
'MonitoringLocationIdentifier' or the 'TADA.MonitoringLocationIdentifier'.
When 'TADA.MonitoringLocationIdentifier' is selected (with id = "tada"), there
may be fewer rows in the resulting data set than when 'MonitoringLocationIdentifier"
is selected (with id = "wqp") due to grouping of nearby sites as a result of applying
TADA functions such as TADA_FindNearbySites or TADA_FindPotentialDuplicatesMultipleOrgs.
