\title{Generate A Data Frame of Units and Target by Characteristic Name}
\usage{
TADA_CreateUnitRef(.data, masstoVolume = FALSE, print.message = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{.data}{TADA dataframe}

\item{print.message}{Boolean argument with two possible arguments, TRUE and
FALSE. When print.message = TRUE, a message is printed that lists any
characteristics (TADA.CharacteristicName) that have been assigned more than
one target unit. When print.message = FALSE, no message is printed. The default
is print.message = TRUE.}
}
\value{
A dataframe with seven columns: TADA.CharacteristicName,
TADA.ResultMeasure.MeasureUnitCode, ResultMeasure.MeasureUnitCode,
TADA.Target.ResultMeasureUnit, TADA.MethodSpeciationName,
ConversionFactor, and ConversionCoefficient.
The number of rows will vary based on the number of unique
TADA.CharacteristicName/ResultMeasure.MeasureUnitCode combinations in the
initial TADA dataframe.
}
\description{
This function generates a data frame listing all unique characteristic (by CharacteristicName)
and unit (by TADA.ResultMeasure.MeasureUnitCode) pairs present in the dataset. Where
possible, the function fills in the columns for target unit, and conversion factor.
Users can edit it and use it as an input for TADA_ConvertResultUnits to
customize standardization of units by characteristic. The TADA.ResultMeasure.MeasureUnitCode
column automatically incorporates any additional unique unit codes from
TADA.DetectionQuantitationLimiMeasure.MeasureUnitCode that were not observed in
TADA.ResultMeasure.MeasureUnitCode. This is done to facilitate estimating
censored data later in the workflow. All variants of TADA.ResultMeasure.MeasureUnitCode
and ResultMeasure.MeasureUnitCode, including USGS results where speciation is listed
in the units are included. This facilitates moving speciation from units to
TADA.MethodSpeciationName in TADA_ConvertResultUnits.
}
\details{
The columns created by TADA_AutoClean are required to run this function. If
they are not present in the data frame, TADA_AutoClean is automatically run
before the unit reference data frame is created.

# Load example dataset:
data(Data_Nutrients_UT)

# Create a unit reference data frame
UT_UnitRef <- TADA_CreateUnitRef(Data_Nutrients_UT)
