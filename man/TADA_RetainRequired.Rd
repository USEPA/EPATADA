TADA_RetainRequired(.data)
}
\arguments{
\item{.data}{A dataframe}
}

A dataframe containing all required fields for use with TADA as well as fields
commonly used for filtering.
}
\description{
This function removes all duplicate columns where TADA has created a new column with a TADA prefix.
It retains all TADA prefixed columns as well as other original fields that are either required by
other TADA functions or are commonly used filters. Using this function allows the user to accept
all TADA created changes and reduce the size of the data set before using TADA mapping or data
visualization features in the TADA package or Shiny app.
