\title{Check for Aggregated Continuous Data}
\usage{
TADA_FindContinuousData(.data, clean = FALSE, flaggedonly = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{.data}{TADA dataframe}

\item{clean}{Boolean argument; removes aggregated continuous data from
the dataframe when clean = TRUE. Default is clean = TRUE.}

\item{flaggedonly}{Boolean argument; filters dataframe to show only aggregated
continuous data when flaggedonly = TRUE. Default is flaggedonly = FALSE.}
}
\value{
When clean = FALSE and flaggedonly = FALSE, a column flagging rows with
aggregated continuous data is appended to the input data set. When clean = FALSE
and flaggedonly = TRUE, the dataframe is filtered to show only the flagged
aggregated continuous data and flag column is still appended. When clean = TRUE
and flaggedonly = FALSE, aggregated continuous data is removed from the dataframe
and no column is appended. The default is clean = FALSE and flaggedonly = FALSE.
}
\description{
The Water Quality Portal (WQP) includes some continuous (high frequency sensor)
data which data users may want to flag and analyze separately from discrete
data. Continuous data is typically aggregated to a daily avg, max, and min value,
or another statistic of interest to the data submitter. Alternatively, some
organizations aggregate their high frequency data (15 min or 1 hour data)
to 2 or 4 hour interval averages, and they also submit that data to the WQP
through WQX. The raw continuous time series data is made available through a
text file attachment at the activity level.
}
\details{
This type of high frequency data may
(or may not) be suitable for integration with discrete
water quality data for assessments. Therefore, this function uses metadata
submitted by data providers to flag rows with aggregated continuous data.

This is done by flagging results where the ResultDetectionConditionText =
"Reported in Raw Data (attached)". When clean = FALSE and flaggedonly = FALSE, a column titled
"TADA.AggregatedContinuousData.Flag" is added to the dataframe to indicate if the row
includes aggregated continuous data, "Continuous", or not,  "Discrete". When clean = FALSE and
flaggedonly = TRUE, the dataframe will be filtered to show only the rows flagged
"Continuous" for aggregated continuous data. When clean = TRUE and flaggedonly = FALSE,
rows with aggregated continuous data are removed from the dataframe and no
column will be appended. When clean = TRUE and flaggedonly = TRUE, the function
does not execute and an error message is returned. The default is clean = TRUE
and flaggedonly = FALSE.

\examples{
# Load example dataset
data(Data_Nutrients_UT)

# Remove aggregated continuous data in dataframe:
AggContinuous_clean <- TADA_FindContinuousData(Data_Nutrients_UT, clean = TRUE)

# Flag, but do not remove, aggregated continuous data in new column
# titled "TADA.AggregatedContinuousData.Flag":
AggContinuous_flags <- TADA_FindContinuousData(Data_Nutrients_UT, clean = FALSE)

# Show only rows flagged for aggregated continuous data:
AggContinuous_flaggedonly <- TADA_FindContinuousData(Data_Nutrients_UT, clean = FALSE, flaggedonly = TRUE)
