\title{Get WQP/WQX MonitoringLocationIdentifier and ATTAINS.assessmentunitidentifier
Crosswalk from ATTAINS}
\usage{
TADA_GetATTAINSAUSiteCrosswalk(org_id = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{org_id}{The ATTAINS organization identifier must be supplied by the
user. A list of organization identifiers can be found by downloading the
ATTAINS Domains Excel file:
https://www.epa.gov/system/files/other-files/2023-09/DOMAINS.xlsx.
Organization identifiers are listed in the "OrgName" tab. The "code" column
contains the organization identifiers that should be used for this param.}
}
\value{
A dataframe with three columns, ATTAINS.assessmentunitidentifier,
MonitoringLocationIdentiifer, and OrganizationIdentifier is returned.
This is the crosswalk between WQP/WQX MonitoringLocationIdentifiers and
Assessment Units that the state or tribal organization submitted to ATTAINS.
}
\description{
Tribes and States who participate in electronic reporting of water quality
conditions through EPA ATTAINS may also submit a crosswalk of WQP
MonitoringLocationIdentifiers associated with their Assessment Units to
ATTAINS. If the organization has recorded MonitoringLocationIdentifiers
associated with their Assessment Units in ATTAINS, this function can be used
to create a crosswalk of known MonitoringLocationIdentifiers and Assessment
Units. All tribal nations record this crosswalk in ATTAINS but only a few
states. If a state has not supplied Monitoring Location information to
ATTAINS, the function will not return a data frame.
