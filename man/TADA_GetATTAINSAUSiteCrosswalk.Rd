\title{Get Monitoring Location Identifier and Assessment Unit Identifier
Crosswalk from ATTAINS}
\usage{
TADA_GetATTAINSAUSiteCrosswalk(org_id = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{org_id}{The ATTAINS organization identifier must be supplied by the
user. A list of organization identifiers can be found by downloading the
ATTAINS Domains Excel file:
https://www.epa.gov/system/files/other-files/2023-09/DOMAINS.xlsx.
Organization identifiers are listed in the "OrgName" tab. The "code" column
contains the organization identifiers that should be used for this param.}
}
\value{
A dataframe with four columns, MonitoringLocationIdentifier,
OrganizationIdentifier, ATTAINS.assessmentunitidentifier, and
MonitoringDataLinkText is returned. This is the crosswalk between monitoring
location identifiers and assessment units that the state or tribal
organization submitted to ATTAINS (optional). If an ATTAINS organization
has not submitted this information in ATTAINS, the function will not return
a dataframe.
}
\description{
Tribes and States who participate in electronic reporting of water quality
conditions through EPA ATTAINS may optionally submit a crosswalk of WQP
monitoring location identifiers associated with their assessment units to
ATTAINS. If an organization has recorded this information in ATTAINS,
this function can be used to get the ATTAINS user submitted crosswalk of
known monitoring location identifiers and assessment units. As of 2025, all
tribal nations record this information in ATTAINS but only a few states.
