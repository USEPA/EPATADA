TADA_AnalysisDataFilter(
  .data,
  clean = FALSE,
  surface_water = TRUE,
  ground_water = FALSE,
  sediment = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{.data}{A TADA profile object}

\item{clean}{Boolean argument; TRUE removes all results not flagged for use in
analysis workflow. TADA.UseForAnalysis.Flag column displaying the media type (as
determined by this function) and "Yes"/"No" will be added when clean = FALSE.
Results flagged "Yes" are identified as usable for further analysis. Default = FALSE.}

\item{surface_water}{Boolean argument; specifies whether surface water
results should be flagged or removed in the returned data frame. Default is
surface_water = TRUE, surface water results are identified as usable for analysis.}

\item{ground_water}{Boolean argument; specifies whether ground water
results should be flagged or removed in the returned data frame. Default is
ground_water = FALSE, ground water results are identified as not usable for analysis.}

\item{sediment}{Boolean argument; specifies whether sediment results should
be flagged or removed in the returned data frame. Default is sediment = FALSE,
sediment results are identified as not usable for analysis.}
}
\value{
If clean = TRUE, returns the data frame with only the media types
selected as usable (set to TRUE in function input) by the user.
If clean = FALSE, returns the data frame and an additional column,
TADA.UseForAnalysis.Flag, indicating the media type (as determined by this function)
and which results should be included or excluded from assessments based on user input.
}
\description{
This function will filter the data frame and retain only the media types
selected by the user. It uses ActivityMediaSubdivisionName, AquiferName,
LocalAqfrName, ConstructionDateText, WellDepthMeasure.MeasureValue,
WellDepthMeasure.MeasureUnitCode, WellHoleDepthMeasure.MeasureValue, and
WellHoleDepthMeasure.MeasureUnitCode to identify groundwater samples. Users
can select whether sediment, groundwater and/or surface water should be included.
An additional column, TADA.UseForAnalysis.Flag, specifies whether each row should
be included in the analysis workflow and why. Setting clean = TRUE, means
that all results not flagged for use in the analysis workflow will be removed
and the TADA.UseForAnalysis.Flag column will not be added.

# Returns data frame with ONLY surface water results identified as usable and adds TADA.UseForAnalysis.Flag column.
