\usage{
TADA_AnalysisDataFilter(
  .data,
  clean = FALSE,
  surface_water = TRUE,
  ground_water = FALSE,
  sediment = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{.data}{A TADA profile object}

\item{clean}{Boolean argument; TRUE removes all results not flagged for use in
assessment workflow. TADA.UseForAnalysis columns displaying the media type (as
determined by this function) and "Yes"/"No" will be added when clean = FALSE.
Results flagged "Yes" are identified as usable for further analysis. Default = FALSE.}

\item{surface_water}{Boolean argument; specifies whether surface water
results should be included in the returned data frame. Default is
surface_water = TRUE, surface water results are identified as usable for analysis.}

\item{ground_water}{Boolean argument; specifies whether ground water
results should be included in the returned data frame. Default is
ground_water = FALSE, ground water results are identified as not usable for analysis.}

\item{sediment}{Boolean argument; specifies whether sediment results should
be included in the returned data frame. Default is sediment = FALSE,
sediment results are identified as not usable for analysis.}
}
\value{
If clean = TRUE, returns the data frame with only the media types
selected by the user. If clean = FALSE, returns the data frame an
additional column, TADA.UseForAnalysis.Flag, indicating the media type (as
determined by this function) and which results should be included or excluded
from assessments based on user input.
}
\description{
This function will filter the data set and retain only the media types
selected by the user. It uses ActivityMediaSubdivisionName, AquiferName,
LocalAqfrName,ConstructionDateText, WellDepthMeasure.MeasureValue,
WellDepthMeasure.MeasureUnitCode, WellHoleDepthMeasure.MeasureValue, and
WellHoleDepthMeasure.MeasureUnitCode to identify groundwater samples. Users
can select whether sediment, fish tissue and/or surface water should be included. in the data set. An
An additional column, TADA.AssessmentData.Flag, specifies whether each row should
be included in the assessment workflow and why. Setting clean = TRUE, means
that all results not flagged for use in assessment workflow will be removed
and the TADA.AssessmentData.Flag column will not be added.

*Need to add fish tissue to this function once new WQX profiles are available.
