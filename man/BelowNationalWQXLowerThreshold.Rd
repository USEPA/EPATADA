\description{
EPA's Water Quality Exchange (WQX) has generated statistics and data from
millions of water quality data points around the country. This functions
leverages that statistical data from WQX to flag any data that is below the
lower threshold of result values submitted to WQX for a given characteristic.
When clean = TRUE, rows with values that are below the lower WQX threshold
are removed from the dataframe and no column will be appended. Default is
clean = TRUE.
