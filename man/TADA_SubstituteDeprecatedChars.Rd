\title{Substitute Preferred Characteristic Name for Deprecated Names}
\usage{
TADA_SubstituteDeprecatedChars(.data)
}
\arguments{
\item{.data}{TADA dataframe}
}
\value{
Input TADA dataframe with substituted characteristic names in
TADA.CharacteristicName column. Original columns are unchanged.
}
\description{
This function uses the WQX Characteristic domain table to substitute
deprecated (i.e. retired and/or suspect) Characteristic Names with the new
name in the TADA.CharacteristicName column. TADA_SubstituteDeprecatedChars is
run within TADA_AutoClean, which runs within TADA_DataRetreival and (if autoclean = TRUE)
in TADA_BigDataRetrieval. Therefore, deprecated characteristic names are
harmonized to the new name automatically upon data retrieval.
TADA_SubstituteDeprecatedChars can also be used by itself on a user supplied
dataset that is in the WQX/WQP format, if desired. This solution works for both
EPA WQX and USGS NWIS provided data.
}
\details{
Enter ?TADA_GetCharacteristicRef() to review a list of all WQX characteristics, the including
deprecated names (Char_Flag). This can be used as a crosswalk between the deprecated names
(CharacteristicName) and their new names (Comparable.Name).

\examples{
\dontrun{
# download nutrient data in MT from 2022 and set autoclean = FALSE
df <- TADA_DataRetrieval(startDate = "2022-01-01", endDate = "2022-12-31", characteristicType = "Nutrient", statecode = "MT", applyautoclean = FALSE)
df2 <- TADA_SubstituteDeprecatedChars(df)
# in this example, "Inorganic nitrogen (nitrate and nitrite)" is a USGS NWIS characteristic that is
# deprecated and "Phosphate-phosphorus***retired***use Total Phosphorus, mixed forms" is a deprecated WQX
# name. Both are are transformed to their new names.
# review characteristic names before and after transformation
unique(df2$CharacteristicName)
unique(df2$TADA.CharacteristicName)

df3 <- TADA_DataRetrieval(startDate = "2022-01-01", endDate = "2022-12-31", characteristicType = "Nutrient", statecode = "WY", applyautoclean = FALSE)
df4 <- TADA_SubstituteDeprecatedChars(df3)
unique(df4$CharacteristicName)
unique(df4$TADA.CharacteristicName)
