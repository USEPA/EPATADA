TADA_FlagSpeciation(
  .data,
  clean = c("suspect_only", "nonstandardized_only", "both", "none"),
  flaggedonly = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{.data}{TADA dataframe}

\item{clean}{Character argument with options "suspect_only", "nonstandardized_only",
"both", or "none." The default is clean = "suspect_only" which removes rows of
data flagged as having "Suspect" characteristic-method speciation combinations. When
clean = "nonstandardized_only", the function removes rows of data flagged as
having "NonStandardized" characteristic-method speciation combinations. When
clean = "both", the function removes rows of data flagged as either "Suspect" or
"NonStandardized". And when clean = "none", the function does not remove any "Suspect"
or "NonStandardized" rows of data.}

\item{flaggedonly}{Boolean argument; filters to show only the "Suspect"
characteristic-method speciation combinations from the dataframe when
flaggedonly = TRUE. Default is flaggedonly = FALSE.}
}
\value{
This function adds TADA.MethodSpeciation.Flag to the dataframe. This column
flags each TADA.CharacteristicName and MethodSpeciationName combination in your
dataframe as either "NonStandardized", "Suspect", "Pass", or "Not Reviewed". When clean = "none"
and flaggedonly = TRUE, the dataframe is filtered to show only the "Suspect" and
"NonStandardized data; the column TADA.MethodSpeciation.Flag is still appended.
When clean = "suspect_only" and flaggedonly = FALSE, "Suspect" rows are removed
from the dataframe, but "NonStandardized" rows are retained. When
clean = "nonstandardized_only" and flaggedonly = FALSE, "NonStandardized" rows
are removed, but "Suspect" rows are retained. The default is clean = "suspect_only"
and flaggedonly = FALSE.
}
\description{
Function checks the validity of each characteristic-method
speciation combination in the dataframe. When clean = "suspect_only", rows with Suspect
characteristic-method speciation combinations are removed. Default is
clean = "suspect_only". When flaggedonly = TRUE, dataframe is filtered to show only
rows with "Suspect" or "NonStandardized" characteristic-method speciation combinations.
Default is flaggedonly = FALSE.
}
\details{
The “Not Reviewed” value within "TADA.MethodSpeciation.Flag" means
that the EPA WQX team has not yet reviewed the combinations
(see https://cdx.epa.gov/wqx/download/DomainValues/QAQCCharacteristicValidation.CSV).
The WQX team plans to review and update these new combinations quarterly.
