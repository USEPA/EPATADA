\usage{
TADA_CreateSpatialRef(
  .data,
  spatialRef = NULL,
  excel = TRUE,
  overwrite = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{.data}{A TADA data frame with TADA_GetATTAINS() geospatial function ran.}

\item{spatialRef}{A data frame matching Monitoring Location sites to Assessment Units.}

\item{AU}{Character argument. Users can specify which AU they are interested in
defining WQS criteria for. If this argument is left as NULL, then all unique AU
records will be displayed in this ref file for users to define.}
}
\value{
A data frame with all the MonitoringLocationIdentifier Sites for a defined AU.
}
\description{
This function will pull in all unique MonitoringLocationName, MonitoringLocationType,
and MonitoringLocationIdentifier from the TADA dataframe. Users are not required
to provide a crosswalk between WQP Monitoring locations and Assessment units
if they are only interested in summarizing assessments on a monitoring location level.
}
\details{
Users should utilize TADA Module 2 tools to assist in their monitoring location
to assessment unit crosswalk prior to this step.
Users can choose to submit a TADA dataframe that contains
the concatenated columns from TADA_GetATTAINS and will utilize the crosswalk of
monitoring locations to assessment units performed in this function (please check out
the TADAModule2.Rmd for an example workflow for TADA_GetATTAINS.)

Users may also submit their own monitoring location to assessment unit crosswalk
reference file which contains the appropriate column names as an argument input. This
reference file will be prioritized as a crosswalk

Users are expected to modify this AU ref table with the appropriate AU and
MonitoringLocationName, MonitoringLocationType, and MonitoringLocationId crosswalk
for the current Assessment cycle. Users will decide to "Include" or "Exclude"
a MonitoringLocation in the "IncludeOrExclude" column. for an AU.
