\title{Identify and group nearby monitoring locations (UNDER ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT)}
\usage{
TADA_FindNearbySites(.data, dist_buffer = 100)
}
\arguments{
\item{.data}{TADA dataframe OR TADA sites dataframe}

\item{dist_buffer}{Numeric. The maximum distance (in meters) two sites can
be from one another to be considered "nearby" and grouped together.
The default is 100m.}
}
\value{
Input dataframe with a TADA.MonitoringLocationIdentifier column that
indicates the nearby site groups each monitoring location belongs to. Grouped
sites are concatenated in the TADA.MonitoringLocationIdentifier column
(e.g. "USGS-10010025","USGS-10010026" enclosed in square brackets []).
This JSON array is the new TADA monitoring location ID for the grouped sites.
TADA.MonitoringLocationIdentifier can be leveraged to analyze data from
nearby sites together (as the same general location).
}
\description{
This function takes a TADA dataset and creates a distance matrix for all
sites in the dataset. It then uses the buffer input value to determine which
sites are within the buffer and should be identified as part of a nearby site
group.

\examples{
GroupNearbySites_100m <- TADA_FindNearbySites(Data_Nutrients_UT)
GroupNearbySites_10m <- TADA_FindNearbySites(Data_Nutrients_UT, dist_buffer = 10)
