\usage{
TADA_DefineCriteriaRef(
  StandardsRef = NULL,
  downloads_path = NULL,
  overwrite = FALSE,
  autofill = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{.data}{TADA dataframe}

\item{entity}{a character string abbreviation}
}
\value{
A data frame with columns for TADA.CharacteristicName, TADA.MethodSpeciationName,
TADA.ResultSampleFractionText, TADA.UserStandardUnit, and TADA.UserStandardValue. All values for
TADA.UserStandardUnit and TADA.UserStandardValue are NA and must be filled in by the user before
use in TADA_SimpleCriteriaComparison.
}
\description{
This function requires users to run TADA_CreateCriteriaRef and fill out the CriteriaRef file.
For each row depending on its parameter group, additional columns for duration and frequency
will be generated and filled out.
}
\details{
If users do not include Duration and Frequency criteria in their ref file, then impairment decisions
will be based on each observation in the tada dataframe with no averaging period used and the denominator
will be for every observation that matches a row entry in the CriteriaRef as no frequency or duration is defined.

Users will be required to validate these values for reasonability based on their state's water quality standards criteria.
This function attempts to fill out default duration and frequency values for common parameters. However,
each state may deviate and have their own defined and approved criteria standards that they use.

Duration is defined as the averaging time period over which a parameter is measured.

If an average is used, then an average based on the defined Duration Value - such as "one hour"- will look at
one hour averages
