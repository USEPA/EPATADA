\arguments{
\item{.data}{A TADA dataframe with TADA_GetATTAINS() geospatial function ran.}

\item{AU}{Character argument. Users can specify which AU they are interested in
defining WQS criteria for. If this argument is left as NULL, then all unique AU
records will be displayed in this ref file for users to define.}

\value{
A data frame with all the MonitoringLocationIdentifier Sites for a defined AU.

\description{
This function will pull in all prior use names associated with an organization identifier
from prior ATTAINS cycles. If a user has included the EPA304a recommended standards
for assessment summaries, then

\details{
for AU(s) from a TADA dataframe with ATTAINS data. This function requires users to have already
ran TADA_GetATTAINS(). Users are able to specify which AU(S) to pull in from this ref file
when creating the final CriteriaRef file to be compatible with an organization's WQS assessments.

Users are expected to modify this AU ref file with the appropriate AU and
MonitoringLocationName/MonitoringLocationType/MonitoringLocationId crosswalk
for the current Assessment cycle. Users can decide to "Include or Exclude" a MonitoringLocation
within an AU if desired. This can be used if a MoniotringLocation would still like to be
crosswalk to the AU but may only be applicable for certain parameters.
