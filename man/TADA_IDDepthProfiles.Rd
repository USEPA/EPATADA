\usage{
TADA_IDDepthProfiles(.data, nresults = TRUE, nvalue = 2, aggregates = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{.data}{TADA dataframe which must include the columns ActivityStartDate,
TADA.ConsolidatedDepth, TADA.ConsolidatedDepth.Unit, TADA.ConsolidatedDepth.Bottom,
TADA.ResultMeasureValue, TADA.ResultMeasureValue.UnitCode,
OrganizationIdentifier, MonitoringLocationName, MonitoringLocationIdentifier,
and TADA.ComparableDataIdentifier.}

\item{nresults}{Boolean argument with options "TRUE" or "FALSE". The
default is nresults = TRUE, which means that the number of results for each
characterstic are added within the TADA.CharacteristicsForDepthProfile column.
When nresults = FALSE.}

\item{nvalue}{numeric argument to specify the number of results required to identify
a depth profile. The default is 2, which means that a depth profile will be identified
if 2 or more results at different depths exists for the same ActivityStartDate,
MonitoringLocationIdentifier, OrganizationIdentifier, and TADA.ComparableDataIdentifier.
A few characterstics are excluded from this requirement because they are expected to
have only a single result in depth units (ex: secchi disk depth).}

\item{aggregates}{Boolean argument with options "TRUE" or "FALSE". The default is
aggregates = FALSE, which means that any aggregate values created (means) in
TADA_DepthCategory.Flag are excluded from identifying depth profile data. Aggregate
values that were selected from the existing data set (max and min) remain.
Only columns created/add by TADA_DepthCategory.Flag are removed when aggregates =
FALSE. When aggregates = TRUE, all aggregate values are included when identifying
depth profile data.}
}
\value{
A dataframe with the columns MonitoringLocationIdentifier,
MonitoringLocationName, OrganizationIdentifier, ActivityStartDate,
TADA.CharacteristicsForDepthProfile. Based on the user input for the nresults
param, TADA.CharacteristicsForDepthProfile may or may not contain the number
of results for each characteristic.
}
\description{
This function identifies depth profiles within a data frame to assist the user in
selecting params for TADA_DepthProfilePlot. A TADA compatible data set is required.
If TADA_DepthCategory.Flag has not yet been run, it will be run as part of this
function. The output data frame is grouped by MonitoringLocationIdentifier,
OrganizationIdentifier, and ActivityStartDate.
}
\details{
A new column, TADA.CharacteristicsForDepthProfile, is created which lists the
characteristics available for depth profile analysis. Using the, nresults param,
users can specify whether characteristic names should be followed by the number
of results available for the characteristic in parentheses.
}
\examples{
# Load dataset
data(Data_6Tribes_5y)

# find depth profile data without showing number of results
Data_6Tribes_5y_DepthProfileID_Nresults <- TADA_IDDepthProfiles(Data_6Tribes_5y, nresults = FALSE)

# find depth profile data showing number of results
Data_6Tribes_5y_DepthProfileID <- TADA_IDDepthProfiles(Data_6Tribes_5y)
