\usage{
TADA_AssessmentDataFilter(
  .data,
  clean = TRUE,
  surface_water = TRUE,
  ground_water = FALSE,
  sediment = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{.data}{A TADA profile object}

\item{clean}{Boolean argument; removes all results not flagged for use in
assessment workflow. TADA.Media.Flag and TADA.AssessmentData.Flag
columns will not be added Default is clean = TRUE.}

\item{surface_water}{Boolean argument; specifies whether surface water
results should be included in the returned data frame. Default is
surface_water = TRUE, surface water samples are retained in the data frame.}

\item{ground_water}{Boolean argument; specifies whether ground water
results should be included in the returned data frame. Default is
ground_water = FALSE, ground water samples are  not retained in the data
frame.}

\item{sediment}{Boolean argument; specifies whether sediment results should
be included in the returned data frame. Default is sediment = FALSE,
sediment samples are not retained in the data frame.}
}
\value{
If clean = TRUE, returns the data frame with only the media types
selected by the user. If clean = FALSE, returns the data frame with two
additional columns, "TADA.Media.Flag" and "TADA.AssessmentData.Flag",
indicating which results should be excluded from assessments based on user
input.
}
\description{
This function will filter the data set and retain only the media types
selected by the user. It uses ActivityMediaSubdivisionName, AquiferName,
LocalAqfrName,ConstructionDateText, WellDepthMeasure.MeasureValue,
WellDepthMeasure.MeasureUnitCode, WellHoleDepthMeasure.MeasureValue, and
WellHoleDepthMeasure.MeasureUnitCode to identify groundwater samples. Users
can select whether sediment, fish tissue and/or surface water should be included. in the data set. An
An additional column, TADA.AssessmentData.Flag, specifies whether each row should
be included in the assessment workflow and why. Setting clean = TRUE, means
that all results not flagged for use in assessment workflow will be removed
and the TADA.AssessmentData.Flag column will not be added.

\details{
*Need to add fish tissue to this function once new WQX profiles are available.
