\usage{
TADA_DefineMagnitude(
  .data,
  ref = "TADA",
  paramRef = NULL,
  UseParamRef = NULL,
  AURef = NULL,
  excel = TRUE,
  overwrite = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{.data}{A TADA dataframe. Users should run the appropriate data cleaning,
processing, harmonization and filtering functions prior to this step.}
}
\value{
A data frame with all allowable ATTAINS designated use values for an ATTAINS Parameter
}
\description{
Users will need to provide the completed reference tables from
TADA_CreateUseParamRef() and TADA_CreateAURef() as the two argument inputs.
This will generate a template for users to fill out and define the Magnitude values
associated with an ATTAINS Parameter name and use name.For each Magnitude value,
users will need to ensure they properly define any additional methods that will
correctly reflect their assessment standards for that parameter and use. For example,
if there are separate standards for acute versus chronic, or for rivers versus estuary,
different seasons, then a user will need to create additional rows to reflect this.
}
\details{
Efforts have been to pull in the EPA304a recommended standards automatically from the
Criteria Search Tool (CST). Users should validate this final output if a user has
decided to include the EPA304a standards. User will need to determine if any
additional adjustments are needed. For example, does the crosswalk between the EPA304A.PollutantName
and TADA.ComparableDataIdentifier seem valid for your organization's method? Is your organizaton
only interested in providing the EPA304a recommended standards for certain seasons
(Fall, Summer, Spring, Winter) etc.
