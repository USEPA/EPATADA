\title{Generate Unique Synonym Reference Table}
\usage{
TADA_GetSynonymRef(.data)
}
\arguments{
\item{.data}{TADA dataframe. If a data frame is not provided, the function will return the default internal reference table.}
}
\value{
Synonym Reference Table unique to the input dataframe
}
\description{
Function generates a synonym reference table containing all unique combinations of
TADA.CharacteristicName, TADA.ResultSampleFractionText, and TADA.MethodSpeciationName. The
function also joins in some TADA-specific suggested synonyms for nutrients and priority parameters.
These target synonyms (denoted in the reference table with the prefix "Target.") are intended to
help the user aggregate synonymous data that may be uploaded with slightly different metadata
conventions and prepare nutrient data for total N and P summations. Users can review how their
input data relates to target synonyms forTADA.CharacteristicName, TADA.ResultSampleFractionText,
and TADA.MethodSpeciationName. Once the synonym table is created, users may optionally edit the
target columns in the reference table to meet their needs. Additionally, the function assumes
the user has already removed any data containing invalid characteristic-unit-fraction-speciation
combinations (i.e. user has alreadyrun TADA_FlagFraction, TADA_FlagSpeciation, TADA_FlagResultUnit,
etc.).

\examples{
# Load example dataset:
data(Data_6Tribes_5y)

# Create a synonym reference table for flagged, cleaned dataframe:
Data_6Tribes_5yClean <- subset(Data_6Tribes_5y, !is.na(Data_6Tribes_5y$TADA.ResultMeasureValue))
Data_6Tribes_5yClean <- TADA_FlagFraction(Data_6Tribes_5yClean, clean = TRUE)
Data_6Tribes_5yClean <- TADA_FlagResultUnit(Data_6Tribes_5yClean, clean = "invalid_only")
Data_6Tribes_5yClean <- TADA_FlagSpeciation(Data_6Tribes_5yClean, clean = "invalid_only")
Data_6Tribes_5yClean <- TADA_FlagMethod(Data_6Tribes_5yClean, clean = TRUE)
CreateRefTable <- TADA_GetSynonymRef(Data_6Tribes_5yClean)

# Get internal synonym reference table
reference <- TADA_GetSynonymRef()
