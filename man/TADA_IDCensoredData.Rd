\usage{
TADA_IDCensoredData(.data)
}
\arguments{
\item{.data}{A TADA dataframe}
}
\value{
A TADA dataframe with additional column named TADA.CensoredData.Flag,
which categorizes results with the following values:
\enumerate{
\item Detection condition or detection limit is not documented in TADA reference tables.
\item Detection condition is missing and required for censored data ID.
\item Conflict between Condition and Limit
\item Non-Detect
\item Over-Detect
\item Other Condition/Limit Populated
If user has not previously run TADA_FlagMeasureQualifierCode, this function will also run that
function to add the columns TADA.MeasureQualifierCode.Flag and TADA.MeasureQualifierCode.Def
because user-supplied Result Measure Qualifier codes are also used to ID censored results.
}
}
\description{
This function identifies censored data records and characterizes them as
"Non-Detects" or "Over-Detects" based on the ResultDetectionConditionText and
DetectionQuantitationLimitTypeName. It also identifies records populated with
limits and conditions that cannot be grouped as over- or non-detects as
"Other Condition/Limit Populated", and flags records where there is a
conflict between ResultDetectionConditionText and
DetectionQuantitationLimitTypeName as "Conflict between Condition and Limit".
A "Conflict between Condition and Limit" may occur if: A) the data submitter supplied
multiple detection limits and the wrong one is accidentally being associated
with the detection condition, or B) the data submitter accidentally choose
the wrong detection limit or detection condition to associate with the result.
Detection limit results missing ResultDetectionConditionText are flagged as
"Detection condition is missing and required for censored data ID." unless
the ResultMeasureValue field is populated with "ND" (indicating non-detect).
In rare situations, new detection limit types are added to WQX domain tables
(and thus WQP data) that have not yet been classified as over- or
non-detects. When these appear in a dataframe, they are categorized as
"Detection condition or detection limit is not documented in TADA reference
tables." In these situations, users should contact TADA administrators to
update the package accordingly. This function is used by default in
TADA_SimpleCensoredMethods, but can be used on its own.
