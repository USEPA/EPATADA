\usage{
TADA_IDCensoredData(.data)
}
\arguments{
\item{.data}{A TADA dataframe}
}
\value{
A TADA dataframe with additional column named TADA.CensoredData.Flag, which indicates if there are disagreements in ResultDetectionCondition and DetectionQuantitationLimitTypeName.
}
\description{
This function identifies censored data records and characterizes them as
"Non-Detects" or "Over-Detects" based on the ResultDetectionConditionText and
DetectionQuantitationLimitTypeName. It also identifies records populated with
limits and conditions that cannot be grouped as over- or non-detects as
"Other Condition/Limit Populated", and flags records where there is a
conflict between ResultDetectionConditionText and
DetectionQuantitationLimitTypeName as "Conflict between Condition and Limit".
Detection limit results missing ResultDetectionConditionText are flagged as
"Detection condition is missing and required for censored data ID." unless
the ResultMeasureValue field is populated with "ND" (indicating non-detect).
In rare situations, new detection limit types are added to WQX domain tables
(and thus WQP data) that have not yet been classified as over- or
non-detects. When these appear in a dataset, they are categorized as
"Detection condition or detection limit is not documented in TADA reference
tables." In these situations, users should contact TADA administrators to
update the package accordingly. This function is used by default in
TADA_AutoClean, but can be used on its own.
