\usage{
TADA_UpdateMonitoringLocationsInATTAINS(
  org_id = NULL,
  crosswalk = NULL,
  attains_replace = FALSE,
  wqp_data_links = "add"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{org_id}{Character argument. The ATTAINS organization identifier must
be supplied by the user. A list of organization identifiers can be found by
downloading the ATTAINS Domains Excel file:
https://www.epa.gov/system/files/other-files/2023-09/DOMAINS.xlsx.
Organization identifiers are listed in the "OrgName" tab. The "code" column
contains the organization identifiers that should be used for this param.}

\item{crosswalk}{A user-supplied dataframe with the columns ASSESSMENT_UNIT_ID
and MS_LOCATION_ID. When crosswalk = NULL, the crosswalk will be downloaded
from ATTAINS. This allows users to add URLs for the Water Quality Portal Data
Site pages to the ATTAINS Assessment Unit profile where possible without
updating other information in ATTAINS.}

\item{attains_replace}{Character argument. When attains_replace = FALSE, all
Monitoring Location Identifiers in the user supplied crosswalk will be appended to the
existing ATTAINS crosswalk. When attains_replace = TRUE, Monitoring Location Identifiers
will only be retained if they are in the user supplied crosswalk. Default equals FALSE.}

\item{wqp_data_links}{Character argument. When wqp_data_links is equal to "add"
or "replace", the function will build the URL for the Water Quality Portal
Data Site page for each Monitoring Location Identifier in the data frame. It will
examine the response code of each URL and only retain those with a
200 response, which indicates the URL is valid. When wqp_data_links = "add",
the URL will be added to any existing text in the MS_DATA_LINK_TEXT column.
When wqp_data_links = "replace", the URL will replace any existing text in the
MS_DATA_LINK_TEXT column. When wqp_data_links = "none", no URLs will be created
or added to the returned data frame. Default is wqp_data_links = "add".}

\value{
The csv batch upload files for ATTAINS to add or update Monitoring Locations.
}
\description{
This function creates the batch upload files needed to add or update
Monitoring Location Identifiers in ATTAINS Assessment Unit profiles. Users
can specify whether all records should be overwritten (replaced) or if new
Monitoring Location Identifiers should be appended (added) to existing records.
