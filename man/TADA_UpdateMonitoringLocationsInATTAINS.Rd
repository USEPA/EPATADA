\usage{
TADA_UpdateMonitoringLocationsInATTAINS(
  org_id = NULL,
  crosswalk = NULL,
  attains_replace = FALSE,
  data_links = "update"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{org_id}{Character argument. The ATTAINS organization identifier must be supplied by the
user. A list of organization identifiers can be found by downloading the ATTAINS Domains Excel
file: https://www.epa.gov/system/files/other-files/2023-09/DOMAINS.xlsx. Organization identifiers
are listed in the "OrgName" tab. The "code" column contains the organization identifiers that
should be used for this param.}

\item{crosswalk}{A user-supplied dataframe with the columns ASSESSMENT_UNIT_ID and
MS_LOCATION_ID.When crosswalk = NULL, the crosswalk will be downloaded from ATTAINS.This allows
users to add URL for the Water Quality Portal Data Site page to Monitoring Locations where
possible without updating other information in ATTAINS.}

\item{attains_replace}{Character argument. When attains_replace = FALSE, all Monitoring
Locations associated with an Assessment Unit in ATTAINS will be retained even if they are not
included in the user supplied crosswalk. When attains_replace = TRUE, Monitoring Locations will
only be retained if they are in the user supplied crosswalk. Default equals FALSE.}

\item{data_links}{Character argument. When data_links is equal to "update" or "replace", the
function will build the URL for the Water Quality Portal Data Site page for each Monitoring
Location in the df. It will examine the response codes of the URLs and only retain those with a
200 response. When data_links = "update", the url will be added to any existing text in the
MS_DATA_LINK_TEXT column. When data_links = "replace", the url will replace any exisitng test in
the MS_DATA_LINK_TEXT column. When data_links = "none", no URLs will be created or added to the
df. Default is data_links = "update".}
