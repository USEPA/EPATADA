\title{Get WQP/WQX MonitoringLocationIdentifier and ATTAINS.assessmentunitidentifier Crosswalk from ATTAINS}
\usage{
TADA_GetAssessmentUnitCrosswalk(org_id = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{org_id}{The ATTAINS organization identifier must be supplied by the user. A list of
organization identifiers can be found by downloading the ATTAINS Domains Excel file:
https://www.epa.gov/system/files/other-files/2023-09/DOMAINS.xlsx. Organization identifiers
are listed in the "OrgName" tab. The "code" column contains the organization identifiers that
should be used for this param.}
}
\value{
A dataframe with three columns, ATTAINS.assessmentunitidentifier,
MonitoringLocationIdentiifer, and OrganizationIdentifier is returned.
This is the crosswalk between WQP/WQX MonitoringLocationIdentifiers and
Assessment Units that the state or tribal organization submitted to ATTAINS.
}
\description{
Tribes and States who participate in electronic reporting of water quality conditions
through EPA ATTAINS may also submit a crosswalk of WQX/WQP
MonitoringLocationIdentifiers associated with their Assessment Units to ATTAINS.
If the organization has recorded MonitoringLocationIdentifiers associated with their
Assessment Units in ATTAINS, this function can be used to create a crosswalk of known
MonitoringLocationIdentifiers and Assessment Units. All tribal nations record this
crosswalk in ATTAINS but only a few states. If a state has not supplied this
crosswalk to ATTAINS, the function will return a blank dataframe.

# Alaska example

# Pueblo of Tesuque example
PUEBLOOFTESUQUE_crosswalk <- TADA_GetAssessmentUnitCrosswalk(org_id = "PUEBLOOFTESUQUE")

# Arizona example, returns blank dataframe as of 1/21/25
AZ_crosswalk <- TADA_GetAssessmentUnitCrosswalk(org_id = "21ARIZ")
