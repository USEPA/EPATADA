\usage{
TADA_DefineMetalEquationCriteria(
  .data,
  .dataCriteriaRef,
  paramA,
  paramB,
  paramD
)
}
\arguments{
\item{.data}{TADA dataframe}

\item{entity}{a character string abbreviation}
}
\value{
A data frame with columns for TADA.CharacteristicName, TADA.MethodSpeciationName,
TADA.ResultSampleFractionText, TADA.UserStandardUnit, and TADA.UserStandardValue. All values for
TADA.UserStandardUnit and TADA.UserStandardValue are NA and must be filled in by the user before
use in TADA_SimpleCriteriaComparison.
}
\description{
This function will ask users to submit a completed TADA.CreateAdditionalCriteriaRef
dataframe. A summary statistics table will be created based on the duration associated
with a parameter and designated use row entry. Duration should be defined as the length of
time that a parameter was measured for for its standard criterion. Examples of Duration includes
a Duration Value and Duration Unit such as "1" for the Duration Value and "hour average" or
"hour minimum" or "hour maximum".
}
\details{
If a minimum or maximum is used for the duration, then this function will flag any results that exceeds the
Standard Value and Unit threshold.

If an average is used, then an average based on the defined Duration Value - such as "one hour"- will look at
one hour averages
