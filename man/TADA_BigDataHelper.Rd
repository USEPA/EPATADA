}
\arguments{
\item{record_summary}{MonitoringLocationIdentifier and resultCount columns from the output of \code{dataRetrieval::whatWQPdata} for the WQP query being used.}

\item{WQPquery}{A named list of query terms to supply dataRetrieval functions.}

\item{maxrecs}{Maximum number of records to query at once.}

\item{maxsites}{Maximum number of sites to query at once.}
}
\value{
TADA-compatible dataframe
}
\description{
This is a helper function that takes large WQP (waterqualitydata.us) queries
and splits them up into multiple, smaller queries. By default it pulls data
for up to 300 sites or 250,000 data records at a time and then joins the separate
pulls back together to produce a single TADA compatible dataframe as the output.
Computer memory may limit the size of data frames that your R console will
be able to hold in one session.
