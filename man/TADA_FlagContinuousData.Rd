\usage{
TADA_FlagContinuousData(
  .data,
  clean = FALSE,
  flaggedonly = FALSE,
  time_difference = 4
)
}
\arguments{
\item{.data}{TADA dataframe}

\item{clean}{Boolean argument: When clean = FALSE (default), a column titled
"TADA.ContinuousData.Flag" is added to the dataframe to indicate if
each row includes "Continuous" or "Discrete" data. When clean = TRUE, rows
with "continuous" data are removed from the dataframe and no column is appended.}

\item{flaggedonly}{Boolean argument: When flaggedonly = FALSE (default), all
results are included in the output. When flaggedonly = TRUE, the dataframe
will be filtered to include only the rows flagged as "Continuous" results.}

\item{time_difference}{Numeric argument defining the maximum time difference
in hours between measurements taken on the same day used to search for
continuous time series data (e.g. if there are multiple measurements on the same
day within the selected time_difference, then the row will be flagged as
continuous). The default time window is 6 hours. The time_difference can be
adjusted by the user.}
}
\value{
The default is clean = FALSE and flaggedonly = FALSE.
When clean = FALSE and flaggedonly = FALSE (default), a new column,
"TADA.ContinuousData.Flag", is appended to the input data set which
flags each row as "Continuous" or "Discrete".
When clean = FALSE and flaggedonly = TRUE, the dataframe is filtered to show
only the flagged continuous data and flag column is still appended.
When clean = TRUE and flaggedonly = FALSE, aggregated continuous data is
removed from the dataframe and no column is appended.

\description{
Continuous data may (or may not) be suitable for integration with discrete
water quality data for analyses Therefore, this function uses metadata
submitted by data providers to flag rows with aggregated continuous data.
}
\details{
Continuous data is often aggregated to a daily avg, max, and min value,
or another statistic of interest to the data submitter. Alternatively, some
organizations aggregate their high frequency data (15 min or 1 hour data)
to 2 or 4 hour interval averages. In all of these scenarios, the data provider
may have also included the raw data (full continuous time series) as a text file
attachment at the activity level.
