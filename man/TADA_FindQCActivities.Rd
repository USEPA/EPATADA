\title{Check for Quality Control Samples}
\usage{
TADA_FindQCActivities(.data, clean = FALSE, flaggedonly = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{.data}{TADA dataframe which must include the column 'ActivityTypeCode'}

\item{clean}{Character argument with options "none", "all",
"duplicates", or "blanks", "calibrations", or "other". The default is
clean = "none" which does not remove any rows of data. When clean = "all",
any rows of data flagged as a Quality Control sample will be removed. When
clean = "duplicates", any rows of data flagged as a duplicate Quality Control
sample will be removed. When clean = "blanks", any rows of data flagged as a
blank Quality Control sample will be removed. When clean = "calibrations", any
rows of data flagged as a calibration check or spiked Quality Control sample
will be removed. And when clean = "other", any rows of data flagged as some
other type of Quality Control sample will be removed.}

\item{flaggedonly}{Boolean argument; the default is flaggedonly = FALSE. When
flaggedonly = TRUE, the function will filter the dataframe to show only the
rows of data flagged as Quality Control samples.}
}
\value{
This function adds the column "TADA.ActivityType.Flag" to the dataframe
which flags quality control samples based on the "ActivityTypeCode" column. When
clean = "none", all flagged data are kept in the dataframe. When clean = "all",
all flagged data are removed from the dataframe. When clean = "duplicates",
data flagged as QC duplicates are removed from the dataframe. When clean =
"blanks", data flagged as QC blanks are removed from the dataframe. When
clean = "calibrations", data flagged as QC calibration checks or spikes are
removed from the dataframe. When clean = "other", data flagged as other QC
samples are removed from the dataframe. When flaggedonly = TRUE, the dataframe
is filtered to show only the flagged data. When flaggedonly = FALSE, the full,
cleaned dataframe is returned. The default is clean = "none" and flaggedonly = FALSE.
}
\description{
This function checks for and flags or removes samples denoted as quality control
activities based on the 'ActivityTypeCode' column. The function will flag
duplicate samples as "QC_duplicate", blank samples as "QC_blank", calibration
or spiked samples as "QC_calibration", and other QC samples as "QC_other".
All other samples are flagged as "Non_QC".
}
\examples{
# Load example dataset:
data(Data_Nutrients_UT)

# Flag and keep all QC samples:
QC_flagged <- TADA_FindQCActivities(Data_Nutrients_UT)

# Flag QC samples and filter to flagged data only:
QC_flags_only <- TADA_FindQCActivities(Data_Nutrients_UT, flaggedonly = TRUE)

# Remove all QC samples:
QC_clean <- TADA_FindQCActivities(Data_Nutrients_UT, clean = TRUE)
