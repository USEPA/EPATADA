\usage{
TADA_CreateParamRef(
  .data,
  org_id = NULL,
  paramRef = NULL,
  excel = TRUE,
  overwrite = FALSE
)

TADA_CreateParamRef(
  .data,
  org_id = NULL,
  paramRef = NULL,
  excel = TRUE,
  overwrite = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{.data}{A TADA dataframe. The user should run all desired data cleaning, processing,
harmonization, filtering, and addition of geospatial components (via TADA_GetATTAINS) functions
prior to running TADA_CreateParamRef.}

\item{org_id}{The ATTAINS organization identifier must be supplied by the user. A list of
organization identifiers can be found by downloading the ATTAINS Domains Excel file:
https://www.epa.gov/system/files/other-files/2023-09/DOMAINS.xlsx. organization identifiers
are listed in the "OrgName" tab. The "code" column contains the organization identifiers that
should be used for this param. If a user does not provide an org_id argument, the function
attempts to identify which organization identifier(s) are found in the dataframe to use as a reference.}

\item{paramRef}{A data frame which contains a completed crosswalk between
TADA_ComparableDataIdentifier and ATTAINS.ParameterName. Users will need to ensure this crosswalk
contains the appropriate column names in order to run the function. Users will need to ensure that
they supply a paramRef data frame which contains at least these two column names:
TADA.ComparableDataIdentifier and ATTAINS.ParameterName.
Users who are interested in doing an assessment for more than one org_id will need to also
include in the paramRef data frame which contains an additional column name: 'organization_identifier'
in order to determine the proper crosswalk between TADA.ComparableDataIdentifier and
ATTAINS.ParameterName by organization identifier.}

\item{excel}{A Boolean value that returns an excel spreadsheet if excel = TRUE. This spreadsheet
is created in the user's downloads folder path. In the R console please type in:
file.path(Sys.getenv("USERPROFILE"), "Downloads") to get the file path
in File Explorer if there is trouble locating the file. The file will be named "myfileRef.xlsx".
The excel spreadsheet will highlight the cells in which users should input information.
Users may need to insert additional rows for:
\enumerate{
\item ATTAINS.ParameterName that correspond with multiple TADA.ComparableDataIdentifiers
Example: An org uses "ALUMINUM" for all aluminum related parameter causes, but this
ATTAINS.parameter name may crosswalk to "ALUMINUM_TOTAL_NA_UG/L" for one designated use and
"ALUMINUM_DISSOLVED_NA_UG/L"
or
\item TADA.ComparableDataIdentifiers which are matched with multiple ATTAINS.ParameterNames.
Example: An org uses both "pH, HIGH" and "pH, LOW" as ATTAINS.ParameterNames, both crosswalk
to the TADA.ComparableDataIdentifier "PH_NA_NA_STD UNITS".
}}

\item{overwrite}{A Boolean value that allows users to not overwrite the excel file
that is created. This will help prevent a user from overwriting their progress when
completing the excel spreadsheet.}
}
\value{
A excel file or data frame which contains the columns:
TADA.ComparableDataIdentifier, organization_identifier, EPA304A.PollutantName,
ATTAINS.ParameterName, and ATTAINS.FlagParameterName. Users will need to
complete the crosswalk between ATTAINS.ParameterName and
TADA.ComparableDataIdentifier.

A data frame which contains the columns: TADA.ComparableDataIdentifier,
organization_identifier, EPA304A.PollutantName, ATTAINS.ParameterName, and ATTAINS.FlagParameterName.
Users will need to complete the crosswalk between ATTAINS.ParameterName and
TADA.ComparableDataIdentifier.
}
\description{
Use this function to help generate a crosswalk between each
ATTAINS.ParameterName used by a specific state or tribal nation and each
TADA.ComparableDataIdentifier present in the input TADA dataframe. The
crosswalk can be filled out by users within R or Excel. By default this
function will generate a user friendly Excel spreadsheet that includes a
drop down list list of all ATTAINS parameters that are applicable to the
organization selected by the function input 'org_id'. It also
highlights the cells in which users should input information. The excel
spreadsheet will be automatically downloaded to a user's downloads folder path.
Users may need to insert additional rows into the crosswalk if:
\enumerate{
\item an ATTAINS.ParameterName corresponds with multiple TADA.ComparableDataIdentifiers
Example: An organization uses "ALUMINUM" for all aluminum related parameter causes
but this ATTAINS.ParameterName may crosswalk to "ALUMINUM_TOTAL_NA_UG/L"
for one use and "ALUMINUM_DISSOLVED_NA_UG/L" for another use; or
\item an TADA.ComparableDataIdentifiers corresponds with multiple ATTAINS.ParameterNames.
Example: An organization uses both "pH, HIGH" and "pH, LOW" as ATTAINS.ParameterNames,
but both crosswalk to the same TADA.ComparableDataIdentifier, "PH_NA_NA_STD UNITS".
}

To use TADA functions to compare WQP data with numeric criteria, users are be required to
provide a crosswalk between ATTAINS parameter names used by their organization and each
TADA.ComparableDataIdentifier present in the TADA dataframe. This function creates a draft
crosswalk that can be modified by users. The default for this function is to generate an
excel spreadsheet which allows users to select which 'ATTAINS.ParameterName' from the
drop-down list excel spreadsheet aligns with each TADA.ComparableDataIdentifier.
}
\details{
Users who have already created an ATTAINS parameter and TADA/WQP characteristic
crosswalk can provide it as an input to this function. The user-supplied
crosswalk (dataframe entered into paramRef function input) must contain the
two required columns: TADA.ComparableDataIdentifier and ATTAINS.ParameterName.
In addition, users who are interested in performing analyses for more than
one organization (multiple states or tribes, or a single state/tribe and
EPA 304a criteria) also need to include an additional column name:
'organization_identifier'. This ensures that the crosswalk between
TADA.ComparableDataIdentifier and ATTAINS.ParameterName are specific and
accurate for each organization. If a crosswalk has already been created in the
past and is entered into this function as a starting point, then any
TADA.ComparableDataIdentifiers that were previously matched
with ATTAINS parameters will be retained in the crosswalk, and any new
TADA.ComparableDataIdentifiers from the new input data frame will be added
to the crosswalk. Users can then focus on matching only the new
TADA.ComparableDataIdentifiers with applicable ATTAINS parameter names.

The EPA TADA team created a draft crosswalk between characteristic
names (TADA.ComparableDataIdentifier) and EPA 304A pollutant names
(sourced from the Criteria Search Tool:
https://www.epa.gov/wqs-tech/state-specific-water-quality-standards-effective-under-clean-water-act-cwa)
This crosswalk only includes priority characteristics identified by the TADA
Working Group. You are welcome to reach out to the TADA team to ask for
additional matches to be included. You may run the following line of code
in the console to review this crosswalk:
'CSTtoATTAINSParamCrosswalk <- utils::read.csv(system.file("extdata", "TADAPriorityCharUnitRef.csv", package = "EPATADA"))'.

If no existing ATTAINS parameter name corresponds with a specific
TADA.ComparableDataIdentifier, users may contact the ATTAINS helpdesk
\email{attains@epa.gov} to inquire about adding the parameter. Users are
free to use any ATTAINS parameter name found in the ATTAINS parameter domain
value list, even if the parameter name  has not previously
been listed as a cause by the specific organization in the
past. The full list of ATTAINS parameter names can be found by downloading
the ATTAINS Domains Excel file:
https://www.epa.gov/system/files/other-files/2025-02/domains_2025-02-25.xlsx.
In the meantime, users can proceed by overriding the data validation in Excel
by value pasting. In that case, users will be warned in the
ATTAINS.FlagParameterName column that they choose to include an
ATTAINS.ParameterName that was not used by the selected organization in prior
ATTAINS assessment cycles.

If there is no existing ATTAINS parameter name that corresponds with a
TADA.ComparableDataIdentifier needed for an organization's assessments, users should contact the
ATTAINS team to inquire about adding the parameter. Users are free to use any ATTAINS parameter
names found in the ATTAINS parameter domain value list (add link to ref file from HRM crosswalk
branch), even if the parameter name has not previously been listed as a cause by the
organization.

Otherwise, users can still proceed by overriding the data validation by value pasting.
Users will be warned in the ATTAINS.FlagParameterName column if they choose to include an
ATTAINS.ParameterName that was not named in prior ATTAINS assessment cycles as:
'Suspect: parameter name is not found as a prior parameter name for this organization'.

Users who have already created a parameter crosswalk can provide it as an input to the function.
Any previous crosswalk decisions the user had made regarding TADA.ComparableDataIdentifiers from
the original TADA df will be added to the new crosswalk. Users can then identify and fill any
missing cell values that were either not addressed in the creation of the original crosswalk or
which pertain to TADA.ComparableDataIdentifiers not included in the original crosswalk.

The user-supplied crosswalk table must contain the required columns. Users will need to
provide a paramRef data frame which contains at least these two column names:
TADA.ComparableDataIdentifier and ATTAINS.ParameterName.

Users who are interested in doing an assessment or comparing criteria for more than organization
also need to include an additional column name: 'organization_identifier'. This ensures that
crosswalk between TADA.ComparableDataIdentifier and ATTAINS.ParameterName are correct for
each organization.

A draft crosswalk between TADA.CharacteristicName and EPA 304A pollutant names (sourced from the
Criteria Search Tool) has been created by the EPATADA team. This crosswalk is still in
development and only focuses on the TADA priority characteristics.
Please run the following below in the R environment to view current crosswalks:
'utils::read.csv(system.file("extdata", "TADAPriorityCharUnitRef.csv", package = "EPATADA"))'.
