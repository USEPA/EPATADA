\title{Pair Replicates with Original Samples}
\usage{
TADA_PairReplicates(.data, type = c("QC_replicate"), time_difference = 600)
}
\arguments{
\item{.data}{TADA dataframe which must include the columns 'OrganizationIdentifier', 'ActivityTypeCode',
'ActivityStartDate', 'ActivityStartDateTime', 'TADA.LatitudeMeasure', 'TADA.LongitudeMeasure',
'TADA.ResultMeasureValue', 'TADA.ComparableDataIdentifier', 'TADA.ActivityType.Flag',
'TADA.ActivityDepthHeightMeasure.MeasureValue', 'TADA.ResultDepthHeightMeasure.MeasureValue',
'TADA.ActivityTopDepthHeightMeasure.MeasureValue', 'TADA.ActivityBottomDepthHeightMeasure.MeasureValue',
and 'ActivityRelativeDepthName'.}

\item{type}{Character argument identifying which Activity Types to look for while pairing replicates
to their parent samples. The default type is "QC_replicate", which includes Activity Type Codes:
"Quality Control Field Replicate Habitat Assessment",
"Quality Control Field Replicate Msr/Obs",
"Quality Control Field Replicate Portable Data Logger",
"Quality Control Field Replicate Sample-Composite", and
"Quality Control Sample-Field Replicate".}

\item{time_difference}{Numeric argument defining the maximum time difference in seconds
to search for parent samples. The default time window is 600 seconds or 10 minutes.
The time_difference can be as large as the user would like, but parent-replicate pairs will only be
identified if they were collected on the same date.}
}
\value{
This function adds one column to the original data frame: 'TADA.ReplicateSampleID'.
'TADA.ReplicateSampleID' contains the 'ResultIdentifier' value from the replicate sample
if a parent sample match is identified. Both the replicate sample and the parent sample
will have the same 'ResultIdentifier' code in this column, marking them as a pair.
If a sample was identified as a replicate sample in the 'TADA.ActivityType.Flag'
column but does not have an associated parent sample in the data frame, the 'TADA.ReplicateSampleID'
column will contain the flag 'Orphan'. If more than one parent or replicate sample is identified
in the data frame, the 'TADA.ReplicateSampleID' column for all samples will contain the
'ResultIdentifier' value from one of the replicate samples marking them as a grouping.
}
\description{
This function looks for replicate samples and pairs them to their original or
parent sample for further analysis. Replicate samples without an associated original
sample are flagged as orphan samples.

\examples{
# Load example dataset:
data(Data_NCTCShepherdstown_HUC12)

# Run TADA_FindQCActivities:
df <- TADA_FindQCActivities(Data_NCTCShepherdstown_HUC12)

# Find pairs for all data flagged as "QC_replicate":
df_all_pairs <- TADA_PairReplicates(df)

# Find pairs for only data with ActivityTypeCode "Quality Control Sample-Field Replicate":
df_fieldrep_pairs <- TADA_PairReplicates(df, type = "Quality Control Sample-Field Replicate")

# Find pairs for all data flagged as "QC_replicate" with a 5-minute time window:
df_all_pairs_5min <- TADA_PairReplicates(df, time_difference = 300)
}
